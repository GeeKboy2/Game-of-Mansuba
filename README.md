# Files Structure

The directory src has all the files necessary for the execution.
The directory tst has all the files that helped us test the functions we used.

# How To Use

make -WIDTH=10 -HEIGHT=6: To compile all files with world size (6x10) option. By default "make" compiles all files with world size (4x5).

make test: to execute all the files in the tst directory

make game: to execute all the files in the src directory and play the game.

make clean: to remove all the .o files that were used to build the executables.
